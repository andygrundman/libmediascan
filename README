libmediascan is an evolution of the work done on the Perl module Audio::Scan,
which can be found at http://search.cpan.org/dist/Audio-Scan

NOTE: Currently the code is very early and does not yet do anything useful!

The basic goals of libmediascan are:
* Extend the high-quality audio metadata scanners in Audio::Scan to video
  and image files.
* Deliver a standalone C library that will be useful to non-Perl projects.

Longer-term plans:
* Explore asynchronous media scanning using threads.
* Support OS-specific change notification methods.

This library depends on FFmpeg to handle video metadata.
